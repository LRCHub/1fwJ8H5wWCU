Heh
I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're out of touch

I've been driving in L.A.
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

And I just want to see
If you feel the same as me...

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die?
Like you're hanging by a thread
But you gotta survive, 'cause you gotta survive?
Like your body's in the room
But you're not really there?
Like you have empathy inside
But you don't really care?
Like you're fresh out of love
But it's been in the air?

Am I past repair?

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin'
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin'
Tryin'a stay afloat
I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke.

Uh oh.

The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I think I'm losing count
'Cause I just wanna see if this can make me happy

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die?
Like you're hanging by a thread
But you gotta survive, 'cause you gotta survive?

Like your body's in the room
But you're not really there?
Like you have empathy inside
But you don't really care?
Like you're fresh out of love
But it's been in the air?
Am I past repair?

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin'
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin'
Tryin'a stay afloat
I got these quick repairs to cope

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die?
Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive?
That's gotta survive?
