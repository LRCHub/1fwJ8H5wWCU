I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much
Haven't caught up
with my friends in weeks
And now we're out of touch
I've been driving in LA
And the world feels too big
Like a floating ball
that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig
And I just wanna see
if you feel the same as me
Do you ever get
a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die
Like you're hanging by a thread
But you gotta survive
‘Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room
But you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside
But you don't really care
Like you're fresh out of love
But it's been in the air
Am I past repair
A little bit tired of
trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of
quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinking
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathing
Trying to stay afloat
So I've got these
quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke
The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy I wish that I could count
‘Cause I just want to see
if this could make me happy
Do you ever get
a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die
Like you're hanging by a thread
But you gotta survive
‘Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room
But you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside
But you don't really care
Like you're fresh out of love
But it's been in the air
Am I past repair
A little bit tired of
trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of
quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinking
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathing
Trying to stay afloat
So I've got these
quick repairs to cope
Do you ever get
a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy
But you don't wanna die
Like a numb little bug
that's gotta survive
That's gotta survive
