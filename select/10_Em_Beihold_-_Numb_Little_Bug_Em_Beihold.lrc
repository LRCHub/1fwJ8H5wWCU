[00:10.63] I don't feel a single thing
[00:13.98] Have the pills done too much?
[00:16.67] Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
[00:19.65] And now we're out of touch
[00:32.65] 
[00:22.39] I've been driving in L.A.
[00:25.03] And the world, it feels too big
[00:27.97] Like a floating ball that's bound to break
[00:30.76] Snap my psyche like a twig
[00:43.76] 
[00:33.65] And I just wanna see if you feel the same as me
[00:57.15] 
[00:38.53] Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
[00:41.55] Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
[00:44.14] Like you're hanging by a thread, but you gotta survive
[00:47.00] 'Cause you gotta survive
[00:59.00] 
[00:49.86] Like your body's in the room, but you're not really there
[00:52.47] Like you have empathy inside, but you don't really care
[00:55.31] Like you're fresh out of love, but it's been in the air
[00:58.28] Am I past repair?
[01:06.78] 
[01:00.55] A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
[01:06.11] A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
[01:11.83] A little bit tired of sinking, there's water in my boat
[01:15.51] I'm barely breathing, trying to stay afloat
[01:18.37] So, I've got these quick repairs to cope
[01:23.49] Guess I'm just broken and broke
[01:38.99] 
[01:27.39] The prescription's on its way
[01:30.09] With a name I can't pronounce
[01:32.82] And the dose I gotta take
[01:35.73] Boy, I wish that I could count
[01:50.73] 
[01:38.68] 'Cause I just want to see if this could make me happy
[02:05.18] 
[01:43.45] Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
[01:46.24] Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
[01:49.20] Like you're hanging by a thread, but you gotta survive
[01:51.99] 'Cause you gotta survive
[02:03.99] 
[01:54.62] Like your body's in the room, but you're not really there
[01:57.48] Like you have empathy inside, but you don't really care
[02:00.55] Like you're fresh out of love, but it's been in the air
[02:03.32] Am I past repair?
[02:11.82] 
[02:05.71] A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
[02:11.22] A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
[02:17.09] A little bit tired of sinking, there's water in my boat
[02:20.57] I'm barely breathing, trying to stay afloat
[02:23.15] So, I've got these quick repairs to cope
[02:43.15] 
[02:28.54] Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
[02:31.81] Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
[02:35.05] Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
[02:38.11] That's gotta survive
